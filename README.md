# Model Context Protocol servers

This repository is a collection of *reference implementations* for the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP), as well as references
to community built servers and additional resources.

The servers in this repository showcase the versatility and extensibility of MCP, demonstrating how it can be used to give Large Language Models (LLMs) secure, controlled access to tools and data sources.
Each MCP server is implemented with either the [Typescript MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) or [Python MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Using MCP Servers in this Repository
Typescript-based servers in this repository can be used directly with `npx`.

For example, this will start the [Memory](src/memory) server:
```sh
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

Python-based servers in this repository can be used directly with [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/) or [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). `uvx` is recommended for ease of use and setup.

For example, this will start the [Git](src/git) server:
```sh
# With uvx
uvx mcp-server-git

# With pip
pip install mcp-server-git
python -m mcp_server_git
```

Follow [these](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) instructions to install `uv` / `uvx` and [these](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to install `pip`.

### Using an MCP Client
However, running a server on its own isn't very useful, and should instead be configured into an MCP client. For example, here's the Claude Desktop configuration to use the above server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    }
  }
}
```

Additional examples of using the Claude Desktop as an MCP client might look like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/files"]
    },
    "git": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-git", "--repository", "path/to/git/repo"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    },
    "postgres": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "postgresql://localhost/mydb"]
    }
  }
}
```
